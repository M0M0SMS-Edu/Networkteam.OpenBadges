Networkteam.OpenBadges
======================

A Mozilla OpenBadges issuer implementation for TYPO3 Flow and Neos

What does it do?
----------------

This package provides the infrastructure to issue OpenBadges badges from a TYPO3 Neos system.
The badge classes can be managed with a backend module and several REST endpoints provide assertion metadata for *hosted*
assertions. A node type to reward a badge once one or multiple validations of an assertion are complete is supplied. This
can be used in conjunction with 

Installation
------------

Add the composer package to your composer.json::

  composer require networkteam/openbadges

Add the routes for the Networkteam.OpenBadges package to ``Configuration/Routes.yaml``::

  ##
  # Networkteam OpenBadges subroutes

  -
    name: 'Open Badges'
    uriPattern: 'openbadges/<NetworkteamOpenBadgesSubroutes>'
    subRoutes:
      'NetworkteamOpenBadgesSubroutes':
        package: 'Networkteam.OpenBadges'

The backend module, node types, TypoScript and JavaScript are automatically registered once the package is installed.

A ``Networkteam.OpenBadges:BadgeReward`` node should be placed on document nodes to reward a badge. The inspector allows
to choose a badge class that will be rewarded.

Implement the server-side code to assert one step of the badge assertion (e.g. in a quiz plugin)::

  $assertionStep = $this->badgeAsserter->assertStep($badgeClass, $node->getIdentifier());
  $result['badgeAssertionStep'] = array(
		'badgeClassIdentifier' => $this->persistenceManager->getIdentifierByObject($badgeClass),
		'stepIdentifier' => $assertionStep->getIdentifier(),
		'token' => $assertionStep->getToken()
	);

Send the result to the client-side (e.g. in an AJAX response) and call a method to register the validated assertion step::

  Networkteam.OpenBadges.assertionStepValidated(result.badgeClassIdentifier, result.stepIdentifier, result.token);

Once all steps are validated, a modal dialog will be shown that allows to claim the badge and send it to a Mozilla Backpack account.

This package is work in progress and not yet stable for production.
